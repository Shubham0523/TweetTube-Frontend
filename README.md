# TweetTube 🎥🐦 (YouTube + Twitter)

**✨ Acknowledgments**
This project was forked from the frontend repository of my friend Chandan Polai. You can find his original repository [here](https://github.com/ChandanPolai/UCHIHA-FRONTEND). I would like to give him credit for his contributions.

I also learned and built the backend of this project by following content from Hitesh Choudhary on his YouTube channel, Chai aur Code. His tutorials were invaluable in shaping the backend of this platform.

## Overview

**TweetTube** is an innovative project combining the functionality of a video hosting platform like YouTube with micro-blogging features similar to Twitter. Built on a robust tech stack including Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and MongoDB, this platform offers a seamless user experience with modern features.
